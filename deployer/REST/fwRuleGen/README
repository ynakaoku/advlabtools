$ mkdir workdir
$ cd workdir

1. Copy template directory to your own.
$ cp -Rp template testdir01

2. Move to created directory.
$ cd testdir01

3. Generate test scripts with specific sections and rules number. If making 4 sections with 10 rules each, execute as below:
$ ./generate_postscript.py -i test4-10 -s 4 -r 10 -p head

The script above will create POST script to create new DFW sections and rules.
In similar manner, PUT script for update DFW can be created. 
Also bash script for Edge FW rule creation is prepared.

$ bash test4-10.bash
